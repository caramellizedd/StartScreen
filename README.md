# StartScreen
A Recreation of the Windows 8.x Start Screen<br>
Made with .NET C# using WPF and WinForms
## Differences with ScreenLaunch and StartScreen
### StartScreen
The main app that has the StartScreen Component<br>
This is has the Tile System and other stuff<br>
Made using WPF C# .NET
### ScreenLaunch
The app that launches the StartScreen app<br>
this is also used to check if the User has clicked the start button or not<br>
Made using WinForms C# .NET
## Known Issues
- High Memory Usage when first launch, it stays around ~100mb after a few seconds
- (Atleast for me) All Apps lags in battery mode on laptop, aka when not plugged in<br>
  Probably due to so much items in that Menu
## How-to
To use this as a start menu, use open-shell custom commands
## Any help with the code/assets is appreciated
